# scapy

- Itâ€™s a packet manipulation tool.
- It can forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more.
- Scapy can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery.
- It can replace hping, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, p0f (and even some parts of Nmap, tcpdump, and tshark).

Why Scapy:

- Flexible unlike other packet crafting tools with limited functionalities.
- Little knowledge required to build your own tools
- Single Replacement for Multiple tools such as wireshark, nmap, hping etc.
- Build your own tools with Combined Techniques e.g. VLAN hopping + ARP Cache poisoning
- Any field in every TCP/ IP layer can be altered
- Decode packets ( Received a TCP Reset on port 80), and not Interprets ( Port 80 is Closed)

Can be used as CLI an package in python.
